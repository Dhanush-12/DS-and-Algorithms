Problem: Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square
number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer n, return true if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return false, assuming both players play
optimally.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
